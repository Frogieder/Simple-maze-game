# Simple maze game
A maze breaking game using tkinter

# Requirements:
* Python 3.8+
* Computer

# Launching:
For Linux users, there's a shell script that can be launched (you'll need to mark it as executable, when you run it for the firs time), or just launch Main.py.

For Windows and Mac users, there's no script at the moment, but the game can still be launched by running Main.py

To run Main.py, you can open the terminal in the folder with all the scripts and run: `python3 Main.py`

# Planned features:
* Winning
* Different difficulties
* Possibly even timer
